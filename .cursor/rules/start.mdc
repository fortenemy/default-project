# start

At the beginning of each interaction with the user, start your work by reading this file and perform the following:

1. Read the latest memory entry from @memory.md and the latest log (by most recent date) from `logi/`
2. Check @start.md for project initialization status
3. Confirm readiness for further interaction with the user

## For New Projects

If `memory.md` doesn't exist yet:

1. Read @start.md for project description
2. If project is described, offer to begin the AI Dev Tasks workflow:
   - Create PRD using @ai-dev-tasks/create-prd.md
   - Generate tasks using @ai-dev-tasks/generate-tasks.md
   - Initialize memory.md from @memory-template.md
   - Begin task execution using @ai-dev-tasks/process-task-list.md

## For Existing Projects

If `memory.md` exists:

1. **Always start by reading Table of Contents** in memory.md
2. Check Task History for current progress
3. Identify next task to work on
4. Follow workflow protocol from memory.md
