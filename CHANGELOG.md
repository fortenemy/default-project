## Methodology Origin

This template is based on the methodology developed for the  ever shameless *bitcoin-trading-bot* project and adapted from [**AI Dev Tasks**](https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks) by [@snarktank](https://github.com/snarktank).

**GitHub Repository:**

- **This Template:** <https://github.com/fortenemy/default-project>
- **Original AI Dev Tasks:** <https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks>

**Development Foundation:**

The workflow was proven on the *bitcoin-trading-bot* project (don't even ask...), which demonstrated the effectiveness of PRD-driven development with extended memory systems.

**Development Stats:**

- 9 parent tasks defined
- 71 subtasks total
- 2 tasks completed (Task 1.0, 2.0)
- 15 subtasks executed
- 2,500+ lines of production code
- 6 modules implemented
- 2 session logs created
- Extended memory system fully operational
- 100% task synchronization rate
- Excellent context preservation

**Key Innovations:**

1. Extended memory.md with 77-section TOC
2. Memory Update Protocol for consistency
3. "How to Use This Memory" AI instructions
4. Structured task list system with parent/subtasks
5. Session logging with max 5 sentences per task
6. Automated task list updates
7. Memory-first context recovery
8. Self-documenting system
